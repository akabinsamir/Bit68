hello there ,
unfortunately i had a few hours to develop the task (5 hours) as i had some internet issues since couple of days , however,
i tried my best to cover concepts to prove that i can handle being part of Bit68 team.


-sidemenu is working , search engine is live , categories rendered and also splash screen and intro screens
-home page and rendering categories is working fine
-handling errors and lack of data is developed,
-cart is developed and tested among other product data using Asyncstorage..
-i believe that products screen is same as categories one but with different data and style 
-modal is coded (product details) , but didnt have time to modify it with the mentioned design

i was just hoping that i can get an extra day as the situation was not so helpful for me , as i developed this in only (4 to 5 hours)

blessings
